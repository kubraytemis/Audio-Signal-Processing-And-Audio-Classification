# Audio Signal Processing And Audio Classification - Artificial Intelligence Project <br/> <br/>
Audio signal processing and audio classification artificial intelligence project with Support Vector Machine(SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random Forest algorithm <br/>


Hi,
Although artificial intelligence techniques are used in many areas, their usage areas continue to increase day by day. Artificial intelligence is widely used in the fields of image processing, text processing, as well as in the fields of audio signal processing. In this study, using a data set consisting of audio files, feature extraction was performed first and then classification operations were performed with support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest (Random Forest) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms. <br/>

This available dataset is the UrbanSound8K dataset obtained via the ''https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound8k.html''platform. This dataset has a total of 8732 samples and 10 classes. Feature extraction was performed by applying MFCC on the obtained data set. The values ​​of 40 and 20 were accepted as the number of features. <br/>

A numeric identifier of the sound class: <br/>
0 = air_conditioner <br/>
1 = car_horn <br/>
2 = children_playing <br/>
3 = dog_bark <br/>
4 = drilling <br/>
5 = engine_idling <br/>
6 = gun_shot <br/>
7 = jackhammer <br/>
8 = siren <br/>
9 = street_music <br/>
